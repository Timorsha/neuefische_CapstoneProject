# neuefische_CapstoneProject

This repo covers the findings of the capstone project from the neuefische data science bootcamp from hamburg. 
Optimize business processes and purchase planning by predictive modeling for a bakery store. The aim of the project was to predict the sales of three seasonal bakery goods as precisely as possible and thus avoid premature sell-outs and unnecessary waste of food and returns. Therefore an EDA and the PROPHET forecasting model are deployed.
